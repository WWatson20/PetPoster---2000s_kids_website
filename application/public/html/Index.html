        Hello! Welcome to my website. The purpose of this site is to post pictures of animals, most commonly pets.
        This is the Index page, which contains information about the website and its creator. At the top of the page you will find
        a navigation menu that can take you to different parts of the site. The second page on the bar is 'Registration'.
        Here you can create an account, which is the first step necessary to posting on the website. After that there's the
        'Login' page, which can be used to access your account. The next option is 'Image Post'. This is where you can put in
        information that will be uploaded in the form of a post. The last page is 'View Post', where you can look at your posts,
        as well as other people's.
